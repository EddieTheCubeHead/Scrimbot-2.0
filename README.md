# Scrimbot-2.0

A successor to my first hobby project Scrim-Bot. 

This time featuring an inkling of what is maybe good practice and what is maybe not ideal when writing a program of this nature. Very barebones at the moment, but I wanted to
rewrite the whole codebase to make it easier to maintain and utilize what I've learned since the original.

All sensible user documentation and functionality still TBA
